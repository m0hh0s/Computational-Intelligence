Homework &amp; Projects of Computational Intelligence course at AUT

------------

### Project 1
In Project 1, I worked on handwritten digit recognition using neural networks. [MINST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ "MINST Dataset") dataset was used.
### Project 2
In Project 2, the focus is on fuzzy c-means clustering.
### Project 3
In Project 3, I developed an in-game AI using neural networks & genetic algorithms.
